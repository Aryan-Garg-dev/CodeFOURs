## Fragmented Clubs, Scattered Updates

In VIT, students face a challenge navigating through numerous club websites and platforms for event registration. Additionally, important updates are dispersed across various WhatsApp groups and the college's website, VTOP. This fragmented system makes it difficult for students to efficiently discover and engage with clubs and events they're interested in.
